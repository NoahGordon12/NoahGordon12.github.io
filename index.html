<h1 class="h1">Hey Guys,</h1> 

<p class="p" style="font-size: 18px;">This week we’ll be discussing the concept of <strong>"Youtubability"</strong> -<br>another important game guideline.</p>
<br><br>


<section class="section-1">
    <div class="text">
    <h3>Youtubability</h3>

        <p>A key driver of youtubability is <b>the clarity<br> of your gameplay</b> to a potential player.<br> 
        <br>
        Gameplay clarity will help you achieve the<br> 
        full potential of your game by working on<br>
        getting <strong>the lowest possible CPIs</strong> for your<br>
        games.
        <br><br>
        Many elements can be used to make your<br>
        game clearer :
        <br><br>
        For instance, ask yourself if a user’s inte-<br>
        raction with the game is <strong>evident</strong>, for<br>
        example, can she tell which character she<br>
        <strong>controls?</strong> Is the <strong>objective clear?</strong> Does it<br>
        look <strong>fun to play?</strong> Has she understood the<br>
        game after 1 second (great!) or after 10<br>
        seconds (too long!).
        <br><br>
        Make sure to <strong>use colours</strong> to help indicate<br>
        the gameplay rules. For instance, in Helix<br>
        Jump, obstacles are <strong>clearly contrasted</strong> (in<br>
        orange here) and instantly recognized as<br>
        a threat.</p>

        <p>If you want to run user tests with<br>
        friends and family or even random<br>
        people in the street, it is interesting to<br>
        show them the 30 second video before<br>
        making them try to prototype in order<br>
        to <strong>understand their</strong> expectations from<br>
        the video vs. the actual game they try.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Make it obvious</strong> with visual elements<br>
        that help <strong>understand the objective and<br>
        controls</strong> of the game, like with the<br>
        target used in Viatcheslav Tarasov’s<br>
        Purple Diver or Fabrika Games’ Draw<br>
        Car with the space dedicated to<br>
        drawing.</p>

    <p>
    People will be watching the gameplay videos of your games <strong>on their<br>
    phone’s Facebook feed,</strong> everything will seem smaller than when<br>
    displayed in Unity or as a video on your computer screen. <strong>You should<br>
    also consider whether your gameplay video is understandable if<br>
    someone watches it on a small screen.</strong> With an average watch time of 3<br>
    to 5 seconds, this is an <strong>accelerated elevator pitch!</strong><br><br>
    
    Think of the moment when you decide to click on a random video on<br>
    YouTube just because it has an attractive thumbnail - it’s the same idea<br>
    for your game videos.
